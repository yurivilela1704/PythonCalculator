Decidi escrever tanto o roteiro, quanto codigo em ingles para treinar a escrita, muito provavelmente terá zilhões de
erros de gramática.

I wrote the script and the code all in english to training my skills on writing and probabily will have a lot of
grammatical mistakes.

Script to helpe me create a calculator

--version 1.0

1) First Steps:
# Title
# Question for user "Select the number for the operation you want?"
# The options:
## '1 - SUM'
## '2 - SUBTRACTION'
## '3 - MULTIPLICATION'
## '4 - DIVISION'

2)Second step:
# create a input for the user choose one of the options
# first and second entry to first argument

3)Third Step:
# create some 'IFs' and make the magic happens

4)V1 DONE: After conclude the v1, i saw another option using functions, and not aritmetic operator,
that(or this, i dont no) will be the v2 and i will add more tree options: only the int part of a split,
 division with module and only module.

 5)V2 done: All done, i choose not

 6)v3 done: add square root and change the inputs, because square root need only one number, but the variables has
 been creat inside the condition, i dont no thats is right.
 v3.1: create the var outside of condition and now, a thing, all is right
